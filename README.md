# Decision-tree-vs-logistic-regression-example-
Here I took a housing data set which is an inbuilt data set in scikit where both logistic and Decision tree algorithms are performed on the data set and came up with a conclusion using performance metrics, a beautiful diagram of decision tree has been done and the depth value of the graph has been done to verify the apt algorithm for prediction
